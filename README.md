Code Fellows Lab Project, Week Two

This project was to create a website for a fake coffee cart business. It consists of a public page and a private page that calculates the amount of coffee the company will need to roast for each day. The private page also takes the creation of a new location and automatically adds it to the company data tables including updating the totals rows of each set of data required. There is also a style guide included. Assets for the public page were provided, the logo font is from Google Fonts.

The majority of this project was an introduction to Objects and Object Constructors.
